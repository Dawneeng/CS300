What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was solving was to create a program that would alow a user to select a course & check how many prereqs were required.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
First approach was trying to understand each datastructure the best I could- understand in which way each was useful. I learned how a vector could be useful over an array, how one might use a hashtable for it's speed for unorganized data, and a binary tree if one was wanting data to be presented in some sort of organized way.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I had a lot of road blocks.  I use a mac which isn't compatable with Visual Studio and had issues w/ my schools apporto site because it would time out mid assignment and not save data.  I was able to find an online compiler that I could use, then would take that code try to run on VS through apporto since that website could not handle larger data files.  I also utilized our schools tutors to break down more complex topics that I felt the zybooks didn't fully explain in a way I understood. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This was a challenging course- I felt like it started making a lot more sense as I moved forward and got more of a grasp of the concepts.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think that my instructors clarification on pseudo code really helped me a lot.  My previous classes we were writing a very basic list, he helped show some sites that explained how pseudocode should be writen and how one could use it.
